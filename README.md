### SeoBox: A Simpler WordPress seo plugin.

#### WARNING: This is a development repository. Dont install this plugin on a live website at this point.

#### What?
SeoBox is a new and simpler search engine optimization plugin for WordPress. It's main goal is to output meta tags for search engines, facebook and twitter.

#### Why?
Even though there are other WordPress search optimization plugins out there that all do a great job in there own way I wanted to create something that is simpler and more straightforward to use and that is visualy more inline with the core WordPress design.

#### How?
SeoBoxâ€™s code is based upon a modified version of the [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/devinvinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate/) by [Devin Vinson](https://twitter.com/DevinVinson) and is being developed in modern object oriented php, sass/scss and modular javascript. One of the main goals is to create a code base that is highly extendable and maintainable towards the future.

#### Now what?
SeoBox is still in development and is far from tested and stable for production use. But if your curious you can grab a copy and have a look for yourself. Do note that it is highly discoureged to install the plugin in a live website at this point. 

If you do want to test SeoBox im very curious to hear what you think. Feedback and suggestions are very welcome. And if you like to contribute to the project in some way do let me know. You can find me over at [Twitter @Vanaf1979](https://twitter.com/Vanaf1979).
